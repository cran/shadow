\title{Create grid of 3D points covering the 'facades' and 'roofs' of obstacles}
\usage{
surfaceGrid(obstacles, obstacles_height_field, res, offset = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{obstacles}{A \code{SpatialPolygonsDataFrame} object specifying the obstacles outline}

\item{obstacles_height_field}{Name of attribute in \code{obstacles} with extrusion height for each feature}

\item{res}{Required grid resolution, in CRS units.}

\item{offset}{Offset between grid points and facade (horizontal distance) or between grid points and roof (vertical distance).}
}
\value{
A 3D \code{SpatialPointsDataFrame} layer, including all attributes of the original building to whose surface each point corresponds to, as well as new attributes:\itemize{
\item{\code{type} Either \code{"facade"} or \code{"roof"}}
\item{\code{seg_id} Facade segment unique ID (only for 'facade' points)}
\item{\code{xy_id} Facade ground location unique ID (only for 'facade' points)}
\item{\code{az} The azimuth of the corresponding facade, in decimal degrees (only for 'facade' points)}
}
}
\description{
The function creates a grid of 3D points covering the given obstacles at specified resolution. Such a grid can later on be used to quantify the shaded / non-shaded proportion of the obstacles surface area.
}
\note{
The reason for introducing an offset is to avoid ambiguity as for whether the grid points are "inside" or "outside" of the obstacle. With an offset all grid points are "outside" of the building and thus not intersecting it. \code{offset} should be given in CRS units; default is 0.01.
}
\examples{
grid = surfaceGrid(
  obstacles = rishon,
  obstacles_height_field = "BLDG_HT",
  res = 2,
  offset = 0.01
)
